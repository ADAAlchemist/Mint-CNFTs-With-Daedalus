# Mint-CNFTs-With-Daedalus
Bash script for minting Cardano NFTs by using Daedalus node

**NOTE!!! Use this script at your own risk, especially when planning to mint something in the mainnet**

Daedalus is a full node wallet. This means that it has a full copy of the Cardano blockchain and it's capable of validating every transaction in its history. It is possible to utilize the Daedalus node socket with cardano-cli. Cardano-cli is a command line interface that provides a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and other important tasks.

## Prereguirements for using this script:
* Linux OS (For example Ubuntu)
* Daedalus wallet
  * [Mainnet version](https://daedaluswallet.io/en/download/)
  * [Preprod (testnet) version](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/daedalus-testnet)
* [cardano-cli](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases)
* jq - command line JSON processor [Installation instructions](https://lindevs.com/install-jq-on-ubuntu)

## Usage
Make sure that your Daedalus is running and in sync.

It is highly recommended to start experimenting with this script in the preprod-environment first. This way you can test that everything works smoothly and your NFT is exatly the way you wanted it to be without using any real ADA along the way.
Select the network by uncommenting the pereferred option. Default is preprod:
```
# set this to preprod or mainnet
export NETWORK="preprod"
# export NETWORK="mainnet"
```
The script is written in bash and it takes one argument, which is the recipient address. NFT will be minted directly to the address provided.

Currently the NFT-metadata is hard coded into the script. Metadata structure follows the guidelines of [CIP-0025](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0025), accompanied with few additional parameters. Edit the metadata according to your wishes by changing these parameters:
```
# Variables for the NFT
export realtokenname="ADAlchemist"
export tokenname=$(echo -n $realtokenname | xxd -b -ps -c 80 | tr -d '\n')
export ar_hash="dkXRrMWTxcj9eQ7XzuR9te-U450cSi8omn90uW64c2U"
export website="https://github.com/ADAAlchemist"
export description="Test mint created with Daedalous node"
export name="ADAlchemist NFT token"
```

Run the script with following command:
```
./mint_nft.sh [recipient wallet address]
```
If this is your first time using the script, you will need to create payment address. After that it is mandatory to get some ADA for the minting process. Next is policy creation. All the steps are automated and the script will help you to get trough.

The final user input expected by the script will be "Are you ready to sign the transaction?". Transaction will be processed by pressing "y" and within couple of seconds you can expect to find the freshly minted NFT in the recipient wallet address.

The script will create following files:
| File name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| fee.txt | output file used by the build command |
| matx.raw | raw transaction file |
| matx.signed | signed transaction file |
| metadata.json | NFT metadata generated by the script |
| min_UTXO.txt | error file, which reveals the minimum required amount of ADA |
| payment.addr | Address created for minting purposes |
| payment.skey | The private signing key **Don't lose this especially if you get the address loaded with real ADA** |
| payment.vkey | The public verification key **Don't lose this especially if you get the address loaded with real ADA** |
| policy/policyID | Policy ID of your minted NFT |
| policy/policy.script | Policy script |
| policy/policy.skey | The private signing key **Don't lose this if you plan to mint/burn more tokens with the same policyID** |
| policy/policy.vkey | The private signing key **Don't lose this if you plan to mint/burn more tokens with the same policyID** |
| protocol.json | Cardano protocol information needed by cardano-cli |
| tip.json | Tip of the block. Needed for calculating how much time until the policy gets locked |
| utxo.json | Balance of the payment address before the mint |
